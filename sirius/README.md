# Sirius GPU SQL engine baseline

[Sirius](https://github.com/sirius-db/sirius) is a **GPU-native SQL engine** from
NVIDIA + UW-Madison. It loads as a **DuckDB extension** and *transparently*
intercepts plain SQL, running supported operators on the GPU via NVIDIA CUDA-X
(cuDF / RMM / cuCascade). Its recommended path, **`gpu_execution`** ("Super
Sirius"), is **out-of-core**: it streams Parquet through a tiered memory manager
(GPU → pinned host → disk) with automatic partitioning and spilling, so it can
run datasets far larger than VRAM. Consumes query plans via the Substrait format;
unsupported operators fall back to DuckDB CPU.

This baseline runs the **same TPC-H q1-22 stream** as the other engines
(`results/queries/stream_qualification.sql`) on the same parquet.

## Paper notes

- Reports ~7× speedup over DuckDB on TPC-H **SF100** at equal $/hour, and 5× on
  1 TB (SF1000) on a DGX Station GB300 (repo README; arXiv 2508.04701).
- Gains come from GPU-resident columnar execution (cuDF kernels) + out-of-core
  tiering, avoiding the JVM/host bottlenecks of CPU engines.
- Standard TPC-H uses no window functions, so every query is GPU-eligible; a plan
  that DuckDB lowers to a cross-product (or that hits an unsupported type such as
  128-bit decimal / nested struct) silently falls back to CPU.

## Build (in the image)

The `sirius-build` stage of `docker/Dockerfile` clones `sirius-db/sirius` at the
commit pinned in `versions.env` (`SIRIUS_REF`; its DuckDB submodule is the
`v1.5.5-patches` branch, reporting `v1.5.5`), installs the toolchain from
Sirius's own `pixi.lock` with `pixi install --frozen` (libcudf 26.08.01, CUDA
13.3, clang 21), and runs `make` for H100 only (`CUDAARCHS=90a-real;90`). The
final image keeps only `build/release/duckdb` (extension statically linked and
auto-loading) and the pixi env's shared libraries, at the path the binary's
RPATH names: `$SIRIUS_DUCKDB` and `$SIRIUS_ENVLIB`.

## Layout

```
env.sh               engine environment shared by the runner and the format probes:
                     config with the IO backend resolved, spill dir
sirius.yaml          gpu_execution config: 1 GPU, 95% VRAM, 128Gi host tier/NUMA, disk spill
run_tpch_sirius.py   parses the shared query stream, runs each query through the Sirius
                     duckdb binary (transparent GPU), times cold+warm, counts result rows
run_sirius.sh        safe per-query driver: one duckdb process per query + disk watchdog
```

## Requirements

| need | this setup |
|------|------------|
| GPU compute capability ≥ 7.5 | H100 = 9.0 (build targets `90a`) |
| CUDA 13.x driver | driver 595.71.05; CUDA 13.3 user space from the pixi env |
| glibc ≥ 2.28, `io_uring` | Ubuntu 24.04 (glibc 2.39). Docker's default seccomp profile blocks io_uring, so `docker/run.sh` uses `docker/seccomp-iouring.json` and `--ulimit memlock=-1`; `sirius/env.sh` probes `io_uring_setup` and falls back to the kvikio POSIX backend where it is blocked (`SIRIUS_IO=kvikio` forces it). `make doctor` checks |
| `O_DIRECT`-capable parquet storage | `/dev/shm` (the runs read the ramdisk copy) |

## Run

```bash
make bench SF=100 ENGINES=sirius        # stage -> run 22 queries -> merge into all_results.csv
```

Output: rows are upserted into `results/all_results.csv` (`seconds` = cold-scan
time, startup excluded — see the schema in `README.md` / `AGENTS.md`). Per-query
and engine logs go to `results/*.log` / `results/*_logs/` (gitignored).

### Methodology (matches rapids/polars)

- **One duckdb process per query** so a heavy query's GPU/spill state can't poison
  the rest, guarded by a **disk watchdog** that kills a query if free `/` drops
  below `MIN_FREE_GB` (Sirius's disk spill tier is also capacity-bounded in
  `sirius.yaml`, a second safety net).
- Each process creates DuckDB **views** over the parquet, runs a tiny **warm-up**
  query to absorb one-time GPU/cuDF kernel JIT (excluded), then times the query.
  Iteration 0 = **cold** (the reported `seconds`, comparable to the rapids/polars
  cold parquet scan); iteration 1 = **warm** (Sirius scan cache).
- Single GPU (`topology.num_gpus: 1`) to match `rapids` (`local[*]`, one GPU) and
  `polars` (`device 0`).

## Tuning knobs

- `sirius.yaml` — `memory.gpu.usage_limit_fraction`, `memory.host.capacity_bytes`
  (pinned, per NUMA node), `memory.disk.downgrade_root_dirs` (spill dir).
- Env: `SIRIUS_ITERS` (default 2), `SIRIUS_TIMEOUT` (default 2400s), `MIN_FREE_GB`
  (default 25), `SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE`, `SIRIUS_IO`.
- To *prove* GPU execution (surface fallbacks as errors instead of silent CPU):
  add `SET enable_duckdb_fallback=false;` (the format probes do) — the runner
  also greps the Sirius log and records a `gpu`/`fallback` flag per query in the
  detail CSV.
